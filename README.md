# Pizza-Sales
The Pizza Sales Project uses Excel for data entry and analysis, and SQL to manage sales data. Sales, pizzas, customers, and payments are stored in SQL tables. SQL queries generate reports on sales trends, top pizzas, and customer activity, while Excel helps visualize and track the data.
